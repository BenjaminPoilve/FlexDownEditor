#### **Introduction**
Flexdown is an extension of the [Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) syntax to allow some basic layout/responsivity. It automatically generate HTML code from a slightly extended Markdown file. 
The layout capabilities uses the [Flexbox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Flexible_Box_Layout/Basic_Concepts_of_Flexbox) CSS norm. The layout is akin to Bootstrap, with a small, medium and big size, which is defined per block by the user, using a `[big/medium/small]` syntax at the beginning of each block.
From a usage perspective, I borrowed @oscarmorrison 's idea (and some of it's implementation) to directly transform the Markdown file to html with a .js file in the user's browser. You can see this project [here](https://github.com/oscarmorrison/md-page)
This website has been made with it, with my custom CSS

### **Usage**

To use flexdown, you need to :

1. Create a file `index.html`

2. Add some basic Markdown

```
# The title

## The menu

![this is an image](https://source.png )

This is the first paragraph

```

3. Add some layouting informations (can't do it here because it would get interpreted)

4. Add the script tag at the top of the page `<script src="flexdown.js"></script><noscript>`

### **Layout**

#### Basis

The basic idea is to split code into horizontal lines using the splitter `///`. Then, in those line, each bloc of code will be given a "weight" per screen size (big, medium, small), and the block will flow. The weight can go from 0 to 9, with 1 to 8 being the standard values, 0 and 9 special cases. It is written in the beginnning of the block, like this: `[bigvalue/mediumvalue/smallvalue]`

##### Examples

///
[1/1/1]
>BLOC 1 (weight 1,1,1)
 [1/1/1]
>BLOC 2 (weight 1,1,1)

///
[2/1/1]
>BLOC 1 (weight 2,1,1)
 [1/2/1]
>BLOC 2 (weight 1,2,1)
///
[6/6/1]
>BLOC 1 (weight 6,6,1)
 [1/4/1]
>BLOC 2 (weight 1,4,1)
///
[1/1/1]

#### Special Cases

The special case are the `0` and `9` value

`O` means do not display

`9` means take full width (and center titles)

##### Examples
///
[1/1/1]
>BLOC 1 (weight 1,1,1)
 [0/1/1]
>BLOC 2 (weight 0,1,1)

///
[9/1/1]
>BLOC 1 (weight 9,1,1)
 [1/2/0]
>BLOC 2 (weight 1,2,0)
///
[6/0/9]
>BLOC 1 (weight 6,0,9)
 [1/9/9]
>BLOC 2 (weight 1,9,9)
